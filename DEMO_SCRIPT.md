🚀 **Twitter Thread: Remote Work Productivity**

🧵 1/5 Working from home? Here are 5 game-changing productivity tips that transformed my remote work experience:

🧵 2/5 ⏰ Time-block your calendar

Even in a small apartment, having a specific "work zone" helps your brain switch into professional mode.
